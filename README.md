## Installation

### WordPress

1. Create and activate a YOOtheme Pro child theme [child theme](https://yootheme.com/support/yootheme-pro/wordpress/child-themes). 
2. Create a `/builder` folder inside the child theme folder and copy both folders from this repo:
- To use Panel Slider copy both `/builder/panelslider` & `/builder/panelslider_item`
- To use Grid copy both `/builder/grid` & `/builder/grid_item`
3. Go to Customize in Wordpress. The Custom Element should now be listed in the Custom category when adding a new element in Yootheme.
